Bio
======
I'm a MCS(Master of Computer Science) student at the University of Iowa. I am closely working with [Prof. Matthew Hoffman](https://uihc.org/providers/matthew-hoffman) and [Prof. Bijaya Adhikari](https://cs.uiowa.edu/people/bijaya-adhikari). I am currently conductiong research in the field of Otolaryngology and Computational Epidemiology.

<!-- Industry Experience
======
In summer 2022, I worked as an Applied Scientist intern at Amazon in the Buyer Risk Prevention team. 
I built a scalable fraud community detection pipeline by applying the state of the art techniques in graph mining.
In the summer of 2021, I worked as a machine learning and data science intern at [ML team @ AmFam](https://www.ai-ml-amfam.com/team). I applied the graph attention network to detect suspicious data entries in the claims dataset.

PhD Research
======
My focus is machine learning on graphs (or graph mining), such as social networks and people-to-people contact networks. Graph mining includes learning representations (e.g., node or graph level), link prediction (e.g., recommender system), node classification (e.g., predicting the onset of disease on the patient network), and information diffusion (e.g., the understanding spread of infectious disease such as COVID-19). I also have experience developing methods for submodular function optimization and applying them to detect infection sources of outbreaks - a collaborative work with Georgia Tech and University of Virginia members. Finally, I have developed agent-based simulators to propose intervention strategies to slow down the spread of target infectious diseases ([COVID-19 simulator](https://github.com/HankyuJang/Dialysis_COVID19)).
