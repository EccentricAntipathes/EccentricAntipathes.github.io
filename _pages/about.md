Bio
======
I'm a PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Iowa, advised by [Dr. Alberto Segre](https://cs.uiowa.edu/people/alberto-segre), [Dr. Sriram Pemmaraju](https://cs.uiowa.edu/people/sriram-pemmaraju), and closely working with [Dr. Bijaya Adhikari](https://cs.uiowa.edu/people/bijaya-adhikari) as a part of the Computational Epidemiology research lab.

Research interest
======
My focus is machine learning on graphs (or graph mining), such as social networks or people-to-people contact networks. Graph mining includes learning representations (e.g., node or graph level), link prediction (e.g., recommender system), node classification (e.g., predicting the onset of disease on the patient network), and information diffusion (e.g., the understanding spread of infectious disease such as COVID-19). Iâ€™ve also developed graph attention-based methods for learning the structure of datasets during my summer data science internship at [AmFam](https://www.ai-ml-amfam.com/team). I also have experience in developing agent-based simulators to propose intervention strategies to slow down the spread of infectious diseases (such as the [COVID-19 simulator](https://github.com/HankyuJang/Dialysis_COVID19)).

Extracurricular activities
======
In my free time, I enjoy playing musical instruments, such as classical guitar (me, playing Kleine Romanze at a concert during college: [youtube](https://youtu.be/gUUJiO6dBcM)), acoustic guitar, and piano (beginner - barely play by chords). In addition, I try to work out every day and recently started running outdoors with my Garmin forerunner running watch.
