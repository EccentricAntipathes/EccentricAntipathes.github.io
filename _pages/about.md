Bio
======
I'm a MCS(Master of Computer Science) student at the University of Iowa. I am closely working with [Prof. Matthew Hoffman](https://uihc.org/providers/matthew-hoffman) and [Prof. Bijaya Adhikari](https://cs.uiowa.edu/people/bijaya-adhikari).

Some Personal Stuff
======
Life has a way of testing our resilience, and my journey has been no different. 

I went through a five-year medical battle following my graduation from the University of Utah. This personal struggle, coupled with my work in the industry to cover medical expenses, has shaped a unique perspective on health and disease, emphasizing the human element of suffering. These experiences sparked a desire to contribute to healthcare, driving my academic journey at the University of Iowa. I'm motivated to make meaningful change in healthcare through diligent research and compassionate care, aiming ultimately to transform lives and enhance patient wellbeing.


MCS Research
======
Currently conducting research in detecting swallowing disorders using machine learning with Prof. Matt Hoffman and Computational Epidemiology with Prof. Bijaya Adhikari at the University of Iowa.

Personal Research Interest
======
On the side, I like to fiddle with personally captured underwater images/videos from my scuba diving trips.
