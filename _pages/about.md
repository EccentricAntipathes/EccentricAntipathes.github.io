Bio
======
I'm a PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Iowa, advised by [Dr. Alberto Segre](https://cs.uiowa.edu/people/alberto-segre), [Dr. Sriram Pemmaraju](https://cs.uiowa.edu/people/sriram-pemmaraju), and closely working with [Dr. Bijaya Adhikari](https://cs.uiowa.edu/people/bijaya-adhikari) as part of the Computational Epidemiology research lab.

Research interest
======
My focus is machine leanring on graphs (or graph mining), such as social networks or people-to-people contact networks. Graph minining includes learning representations (e.g., node or graph level), link prediction (e.g., recommendar system), node classification (e.g., predicting onset of disease on patient network), and information diffusion (e.g., understanding spread of infectious disease such as COVID-19). I've also developed graph attention based method for learning structure of dataset during my summer data science internship at [AmFam](https://www.ai-ml-amfam.com/team). I also have experience in developing agent-based simulators to propose intervension strategies to slow down the spread of infectious disease (such as [COVID-19 simulator](https://github.com/HankyuJang/Dialysis_COVID19)).

Extracurricular activities
======
In my free time, I enjoy playing musical instruments, such as classic guitar (me, playing Keline Romanze at a concert during college: [youtube](https://youtu.be/gUUJiO6dBcM)), acoustic guitar, and piano (beginner - barely play by chords). I try to workout everyday and recently started running outdoors with my garmin forerunner running watch.
