I'm a Computer Science PhD student at the University of Iowa. I am advised by [Dr. Rahul Singh](https://cs.uiowa.edu/people/rahul-singh). I am also closely working with [Dr. Matthew Hoffman](https://medicine.uiowa.edu/oto/profile/matthew-r-hoffman) from the Department of Otolaryngology and [Dr. Jeremy Greenlee](https://medicine.uiowa.edu/neurosurgery/profile/jeremy-greenlee) from the Department of Neurosurgery.

On the side, I like to fiddle with personally captured underwater images/videos from my scuba diving trips.
