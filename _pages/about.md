Bio
======
I'm a MCS(Master of Computer Science) student at the University of Iowa. I am closely working with Prof.[Matthew Hoffman](https://uihc.org/providers/matthew-hoffman) and Prof.[Bijaya Adhikari](https://cs.uiowa.edu/people/bijaya-adhikari). I am currently conductiong research in the field of Otolaryngology and Computational Epidemiology.

Personal Stuff
======
Life has a way of testing our resilience, and my journey has been no different. Prior to starting at the University of Iowa, I faced a significant medical challenge that spanned over five years, post graduating from the University of Utah. This period was not only transformative but also deeply insightful. It was a time of fortitude, growth, and a constant endeavor to maintain equilibrium. It taught me the value of perseverance, patience, and the inherent strength within us. It reminded me that challenges, no matter how insurmountable they seem, can be conquered with tenacity and an unwavering spirit. I bring these learnings, along with my academic achievements, to my studies and research, for I believe that personal experiences deeply enrich professional pursuits. As I continue my journey at the University of Amsterdam, I am enthusiastic and ever-ready to explore new academic horizons, backed by a resolve fortified by personal trials.

PhD Research
======
My focus is machine learning on graphs (or graph mining), such as social networks and people-to-people contact networks. Graph mining includes learning representations (e.g., node or graph level), link prediction (e.g., recommender system), node classification (e.g., predicting the onset of disease on the patient network), and information diffusion (e.g., the understanding spread of infectious disease such as COVID-19). I also have experience developing methods for submodular function optimization and applying them to detect infection sources of outbreaks - a collaborative work with Georgia Tech and University of Virginia members. Finally, I have developed agent-based simulators to propose intervention strategies to slow down the spread of target infectious diseases ([COVID-19 simulator](https://github.com/HankyuJang/Dialysis_COVID19)).
