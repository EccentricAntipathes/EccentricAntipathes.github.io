Big Data Challenge
======
<strong>First Place</strong> in 2017 Indiana Medicaid Data Challenge – Data Analysis

![Data Challenge winner](http://HankyuJang.github.io/images/2017-Indiana-Medicaid-Data-Challenge.jpg)

Our team ‘Random Variables’ visualized gaps in care by mapping mental health treatment capacity and demand in the Indiana state. We discovered potential ‘underserved’ areas with 94% accuracy using Random Forest classifier. Our solution is published on the website of the State of Indiana. Please see below links for the competition, proposed solution, and links to posts that mention our solution.

- Solution: [Tableau visualization](https://public.tableau.com/profile/jivitesh.poojary1464#!/vizhome/INMedicaidChallenge-MentalHealth/ProjectOverview?publish=yes), [Presentation slides](https://prezi.com/view/w8lmPrFwuUAa4oclYSyI/)
